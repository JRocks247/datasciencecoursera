IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES
========================================================

When looking for that perfect set of LEGOS to buy, there's always a couple things to consider.  These things are now at your finger tips with the LEGO EXPLORER.  Within this explorer, we look at things like

- What theme of LEGO are you looking for
- What is the name of the LEGO set
- When did the Set come out
- How many pieces are in the set
- and for all you hard core collectors out there, what is the I.D number

WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
========================================================
